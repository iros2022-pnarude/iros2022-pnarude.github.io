<p>Recent intelligent perception and navigation techniques have obtained wide attention in the areas of autonomous robots and systems. Autonomous robots and systems capable of operating in well and partially-structured environments are emerging. As we look to the future, robots that are capable of operating in genuinely unstructured and dynamic environments remain a significant challenge.</p>
<p> One can determine an environment for an autonomous robot to be unstructured or dynamic based on many aspects. For instance, for UGVs in an outdoor setting we could mean the varying lighting conditions and the many natural structures with no clear object boundary. Typically these outdoor environments lack many dynamic objects. Additionally, one could also consider the loading area of a sea port or a logistics center with consistent lighting conditions to be unstructured due to the many dynamic objects and the lack of a consistent map of the environment. We believe novel methods and experience in these and many other examples of unstructured and dynamic environments for autonomous robotics can be explored in this workshop.</p>
